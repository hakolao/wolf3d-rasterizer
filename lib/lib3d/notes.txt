Remember to check degenerate triangles i.e. triangles
that have overlapping vertices and either don't accept them
or change them to suitable triangles. Triangle-ray intersection
algorithm will probably return either false or crash if given
degenerate triangles.

Triangles that are coplanar to the intersecting ray will cause
a certain determinant to be zero and thus division by zero.
