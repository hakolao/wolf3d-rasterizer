Elemental vectors E1 and E2 (E1 = B - A, E2 = C - A)
are not normalized and will describe any point on surface
with P = uE1 + vE2; u,v >= 0 && u + v <= 1

Vector cross product uses right hand rule and so does triangle 
normals with counter clockwise rotation. In triangle intersection
function we use left handed cross product because it gives the correct
result. Probably because the original source is using left handed cross
product.
